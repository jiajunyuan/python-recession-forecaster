# Recession Forecaster

![](forecast.png)

The United States as of November, 2019 has experienced the longest expansion cycle, yet the media is buzzing with talks of an impending recession next year. Recessions happen around every 8 to 10 years, so the question is not if, but when and how much. 

The first part is to predict impact on GDP using regression, because NBER defines a recession as ["a significant decline in economic activity"](https://www.nber.org/cycles.html), not 2 consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP. The second part (under construction) is to return a probabilistic model based on classification.
